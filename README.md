This project contains the source code for a python library
to handle basic construction and computation using the automorphisms
of infinite regular trees.

Demo.py shows example usages of functions intended to be used 
by external code

however additional functions for retrieving individual nodes and 
printing node information are also present within AutRegTree objects
